Project Despription: Grayscale Image Processing with NumPy**  

This project explores the fundamentals of **image processing using NumPy and OpenCV in Google Colab**. It focuses on **converting grayscale images into NumPy arrays**, enabling efficient pixel-level manipulation. Users can upload an image, process it in grayscale, and analyze its numerical representation.  

Key features include:  
âœ… **Seamless image upload & processing in Colab**  
âœ… **Conversion of images into structured NumPy arrays**  
âœ… **Shape & pixel intensity analysis for deeper insights**  

This project serves as a stepping stone for **computer vision, AI, and deep learning applications**, offering a hands-on approach to understanding image data numerically. ðŸš€
